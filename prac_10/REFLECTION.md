# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually was relatively accuracy because I knew my level clearly.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I would record the questions or parts that I'm not 100% grasped during the course, so I knew my weak links.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

These estimates would let me know which parts I should focus on.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Reviewer would give me many great advices that I hadn't noticed when I was coding,
so I can be more careful in my future work.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Everyone will have different way to finish same question, that give me a lot of inspirations.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I won't change anything, I think all of this subject has been designed reasonable, and the teaching structure is good
and easy for student to build fundamental knowledge.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did all the practices every week and follow the pattern I've learned from this subject.
