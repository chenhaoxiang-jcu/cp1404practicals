# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

    I used to start coding when I readed a part of question, now I'll read the whole question first.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

    Maybe I still need to improve my time management, sometimes I will overthink, which will lose a lot of time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

    I think I am good at code designing and will keep going.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

    I think I should focus more on code efficiency rather than output.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

    PyCharm still have plenty useful features that we don't know how to use, so maybe we can be taught more about 
    the using of these tools?
