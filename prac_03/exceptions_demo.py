Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# When user's input wasn't an integer, the ValueError will occur.

# When the denominator which user inputted was 0, the ZeroDivisionError will occur.

# Can add a validation check step.
